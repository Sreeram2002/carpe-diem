# Carpe-Diem
INSPIRATION


When there came a sudden need for online classes ,many students couldnâ€™t accept the situation. Many students join the online classes and simply bunk without the notice of the teachers. Many students become drowsy and sleep .


WHAT IT DOES

Carpe Diem is a web extension .This extension will help the guardian of the student to know that the student is unattentive during the online class. This works with the help of an open CV code .It has permission to access the device camera so that it can monitor the the eyes of the individual. If it analyses that the eyes are not open ,calls are sent to the guardians to let them know that the student is asleep.


HOW IT IS BUILT

If the eyes are detected to be closed ,calls are sent.


CHALLENGES WE FACED
 The major challenge that we faced was to work out the idea.
We havent had any idea to detect whether the eyes were open or not.
There was a decate within the group to implement this idea to an app or as a web extension.So we discussed for a long time and finally found that web extension was more comfortable for the user


WHAT WE LEARNT
The productivity of people increases when the fell like someone is supervising them


BUILT WITH
Python , open cv , Canva , go daddy




ACCOMPLISHMENTS
This web extension lets the guardian to know whether their child is unattentive  or asleep during the online class.Now the guardians can come and check the student . If the guardian is informed whether that their kid is asleep  they can make a call to the student and if they are available near the student they can provide the student with refreshments . So we strongly believe that this extension will help the students to bring the students mind to full attention for the class.This also give the guardians a belief that their kid is attentive in the class.
